# Evolution-Based Therapy in Lung Cancer 

  

## Overview 

This repository contains a code to model the cancer dyanmics on non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of this project is developing adaptive therapy scheduling for non-small cell lung cancer treatment. 

  

## Requirements 

Julia (version 1.8.0) or newer 

Jupyter notebook 

  

  

## Packages requirements 

- [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/) 

- Plots.jl 

## Project content 

- `README.md` : this provides information about the Lung cancer repository 

- `Lotka Volterra model for non-small cell lung cancer growth dynamics.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing the growth dynamic for non-small cell lung cancer
